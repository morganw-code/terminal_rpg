# Terminal RPG

## Controls:
To navigate the in-game menu, use the arrow keys or Vim keys.

## How to play:
When you begin the game, your player is initialized with the following items:

- Sword x1
- Health Potion x5

Your characters base stats:

- Level: 0
- HP: 100
- Gold: 1,000
- Attack: 10

Players will start at the main hub, and from the hub, you may warp to the shop to access the shop NPC, or warp to the arena to access the battle menu, where you may initiate battle with a chosen opponent:

- Gael from Dark Souls
- Steve from Minecraft

## Saving progress:
Player stats will save to a file that you can later load. Terminal RPG will check for an existing save file each time the game starts.
